I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed my first internship task!

Deep Learning Model Development 🧠 

Classification_of_Peppers_Using_Deep_Learning.

This Task presents a content-based image classification system to monitor the ripeness process of bell pepper via investigating and classifying the different maturity stages. Bell pepper is an important food crop, Bell pepper has a uniform shape with size and color, and the flavor can be sweet, mild, or very tart. 

1-BACKGROUND: 

📍 Deep Learning:  Is a specific subfield of machine learning: a new take on learning representations from data that puts an emphasis on learning successive layers of increasingly meaningful representations. 



📍 CNNs: A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network designed for processing structured arrays of data such as images. 



📍  VGG16 Architecture :A simple convolutional neural network that aids understanding of the core design principles is the early convolutional neural network VGG 16. 



📍 Transfer Learning: Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that enables data scientists to benefit from the knowledge gained from a previously used machine learning model for a similar task. 



📍 ImageNet: ImageNet is formally a project aimed at (manually) labeling and categorizing images into almost 22,000 separate object categories for the purpose of computer vision research. The goal of this image classification challenge is to train a model that can correctly classify an input image into 1,000 separate object categories. 



📝 In this task,  A deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model was trained on a dataset of 2,368 images of peppers  sourced from Kaggle .use a pre trained CNN Model VGG16 fine-tuned. The Accuracy rate  achieved was 100 %. This indicates that  proposed model can effectively predicate and classify different peppers without error and with full performance.
